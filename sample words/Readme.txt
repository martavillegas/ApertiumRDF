This directory contains some "context" examples and their corresponding "gefx" files (ready to be loaded to gephi).

Context files are pairs of "source target" words (in 'lemma-pos-lang' format)

gefx files can be generated using the graph2gephi.py script

usage:  python ./graph2gephi.py inputfile.txt

generates a inputfile.txt.gexf output file
